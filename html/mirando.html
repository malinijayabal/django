        <p>Rainfall in Tamil Nadu is caused by <b>North-East monsoon winds</b>. These winds blow over the <i>Bay of Bengal </i> before hitting the coast of Coromandel, Tamil Nadu. These winds are gathering moisture from the Bay of Bengal and causing <i>Tamil Nadu</i> to flood. In Tamil Nadu, rainfall is also caused by cyclones developing over the Bay of Bengal. During the <b>monsoons</b>, Tamil Nadu gets rain because of the southwest monsoon winds that blow into the <i>northern hemisphere</i>. Due to the northeast trade winds, it receives rainfall in the winters. While most of the country receives precipitation during summers, Tamil Nadu's coastal areas receive precipitation during winters. This is because of the monsoon that is retreating, which ranges from mid-September to mid-November. <b>Cyclones originate</b> in the Bay of Bengal during this time, which makes the weather intolerable, causing high humidity. After picking up moisture from the Indian Ocean and causing rainfall, these cyclones struck the <b>Tamil Nadu Coast</b>.</p>

        <p>In <i>Chennai</i>, rain lashed for over 15 hours, flooding major roads and neighbourhoods, disrupting power supply to more than 65,000 houses, delaying rail operations, and halting flight arrivals for about six hours Thursday. Officials said <b>14 deaths</b> have been recorded across Tamil Nadu due to damage caused by heavy rains over the past 11 days.By Thursday evening, the situation had stabilised with the rain letting up and water levels receding. The <i>Meteorological Department</i> said that “heavy rains over Tamil Nadu and Andhra” are “likely to decrease from tomorrow (Friday) as the depression enters land today (Thursday) and weakens subsequently”. But it also warned of the likely formation of a low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal on Saturday, likely moving west-northwestwards and becoming <b>“more marked”</b> during the subsequent 48 hours.</p>

        <p>The <i>Regional Meteorological Department</i>, Chennai has forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall in <i>Ramanathapuram, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Kanyakumari and delta districts</i> of <b>Tamil Nadu</b>. Chennai and its neighbouring districts, Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu and Tiruvallur, will also experience rains in the coming days.Also, the Tamil Nadu government signed 59 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) worth Rs 35,208 crore on Tuesday. Sources said that if the proposals materialise, then they would generate close to 77,000 jobs. The MoUs were signed at the <i>‘Investment Conclave 2021’</i>, which was organised by the state government. The event was presided over by Chief Minister <b>MK Stalin</b>.</p>
